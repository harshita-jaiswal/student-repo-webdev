          My name is Harshita Jaiswal, and I use she/her/hers pronouns. I have
          been a graduate student since Winter 2023. I am from India and
          completed my undergraduate studies in computer science. I am excited
          to enhance my web knowledge through this course. In my free time, I
          enjoy traveling and exploring city life. I also like to experiment
          with my cooking skills by fusing different cuisines together.
